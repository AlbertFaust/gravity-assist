In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun.
  
* The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
* A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
* The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.
